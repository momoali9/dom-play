          <p><strong>(Start)</strong></p>
          <p><span data-actor="laertes">Laertes: My necessaries are embark'd: farewell: And, sister, as the winds give benefit and convoy is assistant, do not sleep, but let me hear from you.</span></p>
          <p><span data-actor="ophelia">Ophelia: Do you doubt that?</span></p>
          <p><span data-actor="laertes">Laertes: For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour, hold it a fashion and a toy in blood, a violet in the youth of primy nature, forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting, the perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.</span></p>
          <p><span data-actor="ophelia">Ophelia: No more but so?</span></p>
          <p><span data-actor="laertes">Laertes: Think it no more;
            For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
            In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
            The inward service of the mind and soul
            Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
            And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
            The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
            His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
            For he himself is subject to his birth:
            He may not, as unvalued persons do,
            Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
            The safety and health of this whole state;
            And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
            Unto the voice and yielding of that body
            Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
            It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
            As he in his particular act and place
            May give his saying deed; which is no further
            Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
            Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
            If with too credent ear you list his songs,
            Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
            To his unmaster'd importunity.
            Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
            And keep you in the rear of your affection,
            Out of the shot and danger of desire.
            The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
            If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
            Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
            The canker galls the infants of the spring,
            Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
            And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
            Contagious blastments are most imminent.
            Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
            Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</span></p>
          <p><span data-actor="ophelia">Ophelia: I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
            As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
            Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
            Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
            Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
            Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
            And recks not his own rede.</span></p>
          <p><span data-actor="laertes">Laertes: O, fear me not.
            I stay too long: but here my father comes.</span></p>
          <p><span data-actor="polonius">Lord Polonius: Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
            The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
            And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
            And these few precepts in thy memory
            See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
            Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
            Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
            Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
            Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
            But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
            Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
            Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
            Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
            Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
            Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
            Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
            But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
            For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
            And they in France of the best rank and station
            Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
            Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
            For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
            And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
            This above all: to thine ownself be true,
            And it must follow, as the night the day,
            Thou canst not then be false to any man.
            Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!</span></p>
          <p><span data-actor="laertes">Laertes: Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.</span></p>
          <p><span data-actor="polonius">Lord Polonius: The time invites you; go; your servants tend.</span></p>
          <p><span data-actor="laertes">Laertes: Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
            What I have said to you.</span></p>
          <p><span data-actor="ophelia">Ophelia: 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
            And you yourself shall keep the key of it.</span></p>
          <p><span data-actor="laertes">Laertes: Farewell.</span></p>
